<p><span>This cute little book is great for readers of all ages. It is aimed at children, but–come on!–who wouldn’t want to play with tea puzzles, relax with coloring tea kettles, and learn some new tea songs? For the musically inclined, there is even sheet music to play. I particularly enjoyed this because I play several instruments. Just having catchy lyrics is not enough; I want to hear the rhythm. There are inspirational quotes, places for journaling, drawing prompts, arts and crafts projects, and more. What’s also really fun is that there are cut-outs ready for use. There’s even instructions for making a traditional paper tea lantern, which was nice. The games included can be a bit silly, but they are fun and would make great ice-breakers for older people. The recipes included in this book are easy yet delectable, too. Overall, this” book is a must-have. It’s both extremely fun and extremely practical.</span></p>

<h3>Introduction &amp; recipes by Bruce Richardson</h3>
<p>Dorothea Johnson's life is dedicated to equipping people with skills so that they might feel comfortable in all social settings. Her former son-in-law, Aerosmith's lead singer Steven Tyler, calls her the "Protocol Police," but granddaughter, actress Liv Tyler, believes strongly in Gramm's advice on manners. Johnson, founder of The Protocol School of Washington, has accompanied her famous granddaughter to film sets around the world since the actress was in her mid-teens. Together, they have dined with the most influential people in the world of film. Now the glamorous cover girl-turned-film star is herself a mother of a young son, Milo.</p>
<p>The arrival of a great-grandson has inspired Johnson to write <em>Children's Tea &amp; Etiquette</em> in which the main characters learn basic manners when they attend a tea party for grandparents and grandchildren. The illustrated children's book features simple lessons in shaking hands, giving introductions, making eye contact, picking up a napkin, brewing and drinking tea, and writing a thank you note, all the things grandparents can sometimes achieve more easily than parents.</p>
<p>Dorothea Johnson is the Resident Etiquette Expert for the Ellen Degeneres television talk show.</p></td>
